# CSDS 499 Project 1 (Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter for SLAM)

Overleaf link: https://www.overleaf.com/project/616745d602523a0a26b2a4fd

TODO:
- sensor model 
- create map 
- motion and measurement model (odometry)
- particle filter (just localization, without mapping) for motion model
- improvement (future)



Outline: 
- mapping with known poses 
- naive particle filter (optional)
- naive RBPF 
- improved RBPF
